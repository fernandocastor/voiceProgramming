# An Investigation into Programming by Voice, by Lindsey Snell

At the time this report was written, 500,000 individuals had reported suffering from RSI in the UK, 80% of whom were habitual keyboard users. To the best of my knowledge, these numbers are based on self-reporting (there is at least one paper I found which suggests that these numbers in practice are actually much lower).

This report focuses on the development of a tool for voice-based programming. It groups together program input concerns and navigation concerns, apparently. 

The paper mentions some related (very old) initiatives in the academic context to support programming by voice. According to the author, these approaces support macro-like structures that are pattern-matched against text obtained from a speech recognition system. In other words, they do not seem to recognize parts of program as the user inputs them. One of them, to deal with the problem of having to refer to multiple variable and function names in the program keeps a registry that associates numbers with these elements and supports the developer in using those numbers, instead of the actual names. These systems target Perl and Java code. 

The four basic tasks supported by an IDE are writing, debugging, compiling, and executing code. All of them can be assisted by voice, although I personally don't see what is the challenge to compilation (it's just one command). Debugging is clearly challenging from a navigational standpoint. Execution is, to me, the more general problem of interacting with the OS  and its applications by voice. 

The paper highlights four difficulties with programming by speech: (i) personal style; (ii) input of identifier names, since they can have multiple words, camel case, etc.; (iii) the use of constructs such as while and for loops, which leverage multiple non-alphanumeric characters; and (iv) navigation, including using menus. 

Three basic functionalities provided by the authors proposal: macros that the developer can define keywords that will be replaced by higher-level constructs; constructors for language structures such as loops and conditionals, that work as templates that require specific information to be provided by the developer depending on the type of the structure, for example, the condition of an if statement; and white space elimination because existing speech recognition systems insert the white spaces everywhere. In addition, the editor presents numbering for any list of elements that the developer may have to choose from, for example in order to specify what is the correct name of a variable that is being defined, because these numbers make it easier to refer to these items. As a visual assist to the developer, the system keeps showing lists of identifiers of things that the developer has defined. 

The author has developed multiple versions off her voice-based programming environment. From what I could grasp the main difference between each version pertains to how it builds the names of identifiers. To evaluate these versions she conducted a study where she measured the number of words that a user would need to vocalize to build a program. The paper also includes a user study but I don't think it is very reliable. Furthermore, I could not find a version of the report that includes all the figures where the main results are presented, so it becomes difficult to judge whether the results were really good or not.
