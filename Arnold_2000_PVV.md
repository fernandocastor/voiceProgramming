# Programming by Voice: VoiceProgramming, by Stephen C. Arnold, Leo Mark, and John Goldthwaite

One of the main issues that this paper and emphasizes is that computer programs are often comprised of abbreviations and collections of glued-together English words, and instead of easily recognizable single words. The paper also highlights the importance of having a programming environment that provides multiple features for auto completion of code (with identifiers, syntactic structures) and which records the vocabulary of a program, so as to make the usage of these auto completion features more efficient. It mentions navigation, specially for nested structures, as one of the challenges for a system such as this. The paper makes no mention, however, about how the proposed approach can deal with the ambiguity and imprecision that are intrinsic to voice recognition. 

From what I could grasp the main inside of the paper is the use of something called syntax-directed editors. These editors represents the syntax of the program in a much more direct manner then regular text editors, Making it more straightforward for the developer, for example, to select a syntactic construct or to navigate between constructs. 

This paper presents a proposal for the construction of a generator for voice-based programming environments. The main issue with the paper is that it's only that, a proposal. 

Since it is only a proposal, no evaluation was conducted. nevertheless,The paper dust mention to possible hypotheses for validation: 

- **(H1)** Programming is faster using a syntax-directed voice recognition system  than using a natural language recognition system; and
- **(H2)** A programmer with carpal tunnel syndrome or some other kind of motor impairment will be able to program at a minimum speed that is acceptable from the viewpoint of employment as the developer.

Even though I don't think it is feasible in practice, the authors discuss the interesting idea of conducting a multi-month evaluation Where the subjects are monitored continuously.
