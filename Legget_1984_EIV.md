# An Empirical Investigation of Voice as an Input Modality for Computer Programming, by John Legget and Glen Williams

This is a very old paper, published in 1984. It is the oldest reference we could find that investigates the idea of leveraging speech recognition to support programming activities and is valuable if nothing else because of that. This paper does not seem to propose anything specific to improve speech recognition so as to better assist software developers. This is understandable, since (i) speech recognition technology itself was still very recent at the time, with just a few studies, the oldest of them (referred by the paper) from 1977, and (ii) language-directed editing environment, something that is completely taken for granted nowadays, were also something very new. 

The study used a repeated measures variable design where each subject had to use both a voice-based syntax-directed editor and a keyboard-based editor. The programming language of choice was SP/4, a compatible subset of PL/I. The results of the paper are interesting and surprising. First, subjects were able to complete more tasks by keyboard (70%) than by using voice (50-55%). However, according to the authors, keyboard users made more mistakes than voice users. Furthermore, for the inputting of editing commands, voice was actually more efficient than the keyboard. Having said this, navigation in programming editors evolved considerably since then. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the subjects were all well-versed in programming using a keyboard but were novices in using voice to produce input.
